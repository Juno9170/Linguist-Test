### Aim
The aim of this projectâ€™s game engine is to provide a fully customizable environment and to have the ability to integrate smoothly with all other sections of this project.

### Choice
When it comes down to which game engine to choose it is narrowed down to three options based solely on the extensive resources and documentation provided along with them:
Godot, Unreal, and Unity.

(note* all three are free to use)

### Summary of Choices
In summary:

Godot, GDScript, C++ and C#
Lightweight open source engine,
(released under the permissive MIT license) .


Unreal, C++
Intensive source-available engine.
Extensive asset library. Particularly interested in the 3D targeted assets: player controller, environment controller, etc.
Very scalable in the sense that we can do open world (and more detailed graphics and effects) enabled by powerful rendering with Nanite, internal mesh format and rendering tech.

Unity, C#
Often considered less optimized for very large, complex 3D world


For our non-commercial purposes, as well as the non demand for advanced features choosing any of the three would be an acceptable decision.
