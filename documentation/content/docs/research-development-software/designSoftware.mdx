# Options

### Tinkercad

- Price: Free
- Company: Autodesk

| **Pros**             | **Cons**              |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Beginner friendly    | Might be too basic    |
| Free to use          | Limited customization |
| Works on web browser |                       |

Tinkercad allows for simple 3D design for non-complicated things. It has a huge library of designs made by the community.
It allows for easy design and 3D printing.

### Autodesk Fusion 360

- Price: Student subscription or free for a year
- Company: Autodesk

| **Pros**                  | **Cons**                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Free for students         | Harder to use                   |
| Collaboration tools       | Higher system specs             |
| Rendering and simulation  | Steeper learning curve          |
| Advanced Parametric tools | Subscription for commerical use |

Fusion 360 is a much more powerful and complicated program.
It has many advanced features, such as freeform modeling.
The learning curve is steep, and we were recommended by a more experienced individual that NX Student is much better.

### NX Student

- Price: Student subscription
- Company: Siemens

| **Pros**                   | **Cons**       |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Free for students          | Very complex   |
| Freeform shape modelling   | Resource-heavy |
| More advanced capabilities | Windows only   |

After realizing that NX Student was windows only, I tried using CrossOver and a VM to run it, however I had no luck.
Doing research about it led us to a feeling that it was also a very complicated program that was way more powerful for anything we needed.

### OpenSCAD

- Price: Free
- Company: None, open source

| **Pros**             | **Cons**                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Free and open source | Limited GUI             |
| Works offline        | Fewer advanced features |
| Cross-platform       | Requires coding         |

We found OpenSCAD as a very simple/old program that does a good job at 3D modeling.
The problems we ran into was that GUI was not as intuitive and that trying to create a 3D model with code was harder than expected.

## Choice

After going through the options, we decided on **Tinkercad** because it offered the most ease with creating designs, and anyone can use it.
Even though **Fusion 360** was super complicated for what we needed, it would probably be the next choice if Tinkercad did not exist.
So for this project, we settled on a super simple but effective tool that met all our needs without overwhelming complexity.
