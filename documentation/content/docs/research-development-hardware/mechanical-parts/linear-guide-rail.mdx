## Overview

A linear guide rail is a mechanical component used to provide smooth and precise linear motion. It consists of a rail and a carriage that moves along the rail with minimal friction. In the context of this project, linear guide rails are used to ensure accurate and stable movement of mechanical parts, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the system.

The guide rail is the backbone of this project, and thus, is the first part that we chose and committed to so that we can design the rest of the project around it.

## Options

| Model          | Length (mm) | Price ($) | Description                          |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| MGN X C/H      | 300-400     | 10-20     | Compact and precise guide rail |
| HGR 15/20      | 300-500     | 40        | Heavy-duty high load guide rail          |
| LML 12         | 200-300     | 15-25     | High-load low-profile guide rail          |
| SGR 15/20 N    | 100-600     | 50        | Smooth, very robust guide rail   |

### Selection
- **Model:** MGN 9H

The MGN class was the only actually affordable option, and the 9H struck a balance between strength and weight

## Specifications
- Dimensions: The MGN9H carriage is `39.9 mm` long, `20 mm` wide, and `8 mm` thick. The rail width is `9 mm` and height is `6.5mm`. We chose the `350mm` long rail variant.
- Material: The MGN9H carriage is made of carbon steel.
- Prestress: The MGN9H has a medium load guidance and high accuracy Z0 prestress, but ZF and Z1 preloads are also available. We will chose the Z1 preload option as there will be massive forces on the rail, and we do not want backlash or deflection.
