## Overview of Printer Materials

When selecting printer materials, I consider the following factors:

1. **Printer Compatibility**: This includes the required printing temperatures and the material's hygroscopic nature (how much moisture it absorbs from the air).
2. **Price**: The cost of the material.
3. **Strength**: The durability and mechanical properties of the material.

## Options

#### PLA+
PLA+ is an enhanced version of standard PLA. It is easy to print with, has good strength, and is relatively inexpensive. However, it is somewhat hygroscopic and requires proper storage.

#### PETG
PETG offers a good balance between ease of printing and strength. It is basically the same strength as PLA+ and less hygroscopic, but it requires higher printing temperatures and can be pricier.

#### PCTG
PCTG is similar to PETG but offers much better impact resistance. It is also less hygroscopic and requires similar printing temperatures to PETG. It is the most expensive option however.

#### PLA Carbon Fiber
PLA Carbon Fiber is a composite material that offers excellent strength and stiffness. It is more expensive than standard PLA+ and requires a hardened nozzle due to its abrasive nature.

### Consideration of Stiff TPU (99d)
I wanted to consider stiff TPU (99d) for its flexibility and durability, but I couldn't find a reliable source for this material.


## Selection

We chose to start with PLA+ because it was the cheapest option and offered sufficient strength given initial testing. We will consider switching materials if something goes wrong, but PLA+ is good for our use case.
