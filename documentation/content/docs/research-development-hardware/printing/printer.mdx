## Choice

Although we really wanted to go with the **Bambu Labs A1 Mini** because I felt as if this was the best choice in terms of everything especially speed, the small size was a deal breaker.
The final choice is the **Elegoo Neptune 3 Plus**, as this one was the runner up in print experince but offers a much larger printing volume. For future projects, Bambu Labs will be our top choice.
