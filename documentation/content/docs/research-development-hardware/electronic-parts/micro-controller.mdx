## Choice

After going through the options, we decided on the **Arduino Mega** because it offered the most compatibility with external attachments, and the most support for development. 
The **ESP32** was in close second with its wifi and bluetooth support, which would allow us to communicate wirelessly with the microcontroller. 
However, for this project, we settled on a wired connection to reduce complexity.
